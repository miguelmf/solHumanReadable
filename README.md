# Solana Address to Human Readable Names Extension

**TLDR: This extension replaces SOL addresses for human-readable names on solscan.io.**

Are you a believer in accessible education, quality healthcare, and efficient public transportation? Do you think everyone should contribute their fair share towards building better public infrastructure for all? Solving for happiness entails that.

Ever wondered why someone can afford a luxury car without ever seeming to declare their income? Cryptocurrency might be the culprit. With the rise of decentralized finance, tracking financial activities has become increasingly challenging. But that doesn't mean it's impossible.

This browser extension allows you to replace Solana wallet addresses, in solscan.io, with human-readable names. This makes it easier for you stalk your target's financial activities and create a comprehensive record of their transactions. By seamlessly integrating with solscan.io, you can quickly identify wallet addresses and associate them with meaningful names, enabling you to track their movements with ease.

With this extension, you can monitor individuals or entities of interest, ensuring transparency and accountability in the realm of cryptocurrency. Whether you're concerned about tax evasion, money laundering, or simply curious about someone's financial dealings, this tool empowers you to take action.

## TODO

- Support for Firefox. As it is, this is for chrome-based (i.e., chrome, brave, etc). I want to add support for Firefox based browsers.
- There is an annoying but that, if you go back the page, some addresses will not be replaced. If you refresh the page, it fixes itself though.
- Style the popup window.
- Add support for disabling/enabling colors, and use other types of words. By default, it uses \[animals\]-\[positiveWord\]-\[color\]. Maybe allow to use \[plants\] instead or whatever.
